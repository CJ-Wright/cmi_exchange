===========

example scripts for the diffpy.srfit data fitting framework

This project is a collection of examples for learning the diffpy.srfit and
diffpy.srreal Python libraries. diffpy.srfit is a data optimization framework
designed for fitting crystal structure models to experimental data.
diffpy.srreal is a set of calculators for pair distribution function, bond
valence sums from a known crystal structure model.
