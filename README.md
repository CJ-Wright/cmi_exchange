# CMI Exchange

This project is a community developed collection of sample scripts, functions
and IPython plugins related to the DiffPy-CMI complex modeling framework. 
To get started, clone this project to your local machine or download the zip file.
If you are new to DiffPy-CMI, browse through the [available files](./cmi_scripts/) to get a feel for
what DiffPy-CMI can do.  If you've written a useful or instructive piece of code using any
part of the DiffPy-CMI framework, feel free to share your work with the community. 
If you are new to git and would like to learn how to contribute

New User Tips
-------------

Some of the above examples are written as IPython notebooks (extension
.ipynb).  An IPython notebook creates an interactive computational environment
similar to Mathematica.  To start notebook mode in IPython, run the command

    ipython notebook
    
You can then load the .ipynb file directly into your workspace. Alternatively,
you can run 

    ipython notebook name_of_notebook.ipynb

to load the notebook file directly. You can then interactivly run the script
step by step, changing individual parts and updating the result by typing
"Ctrl+Enter".
